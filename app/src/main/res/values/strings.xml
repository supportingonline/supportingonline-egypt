    <string name="aboutusedes">-Social networking site, make friends with users, create a free account on the site, and use all social networking features to add and accept friends, add comments, photos, and chat for free.
The site provides an additional service and organizes forms; it organizes support forms\n\n
-Each user has the right to start two forms so that users can exchange forms.\n\n
-The site organizes a model between the user and his friends who carry out financial support between each other with fixed and fixed service fees regardless of the price or quality of the model, as set forth in the policies, terms and conditions.
It also provides a service to organize financial support among users of the site, and we have a certificate of intellectual property rights and deposit number 003224
    It is accredited in 168 countries by the Berne Convention.\n\n
-The site offers 6 different templates, the user can choose any model or simply in conjunction with his friends and this means that the use of models is entirely optional at the user\'s request.\n\n
-The user determines the price of the model from the 4 options provided by the site with his friends the form on $ 25 and $ 50 and $ 75 and $ 100.\n
-The friends are dealing by their national currency, by a   fixed measuring unit which is equivalent to dollars\n\n
-Friends can exchange unlimited forms for each other for a fixed service charge each time they subscribe to a model regardless of the type or value of the model.\n\n
-Fees are paid once per time the model is used.\n\n
-In variable-member models, no one remains in place forever. Each user of the form will receive the support payments from friends permanently and can join the same form once again by paying the amount of the personally paid personal support and paying the fees again. Invite friends and supporters again.\n\n

-The site uses only service fees of only $ 5,
    In order to organize, arrange and coordinate through the codes governing the exit operations of the user who received the amount of support from his friends,
 And the entry of the participants and arrange their entry among them in the same model.\n\n

    -The user agrees with his friends who support him in the form on ways to send and receive financial support among themselves in any way they wish to send and receive different funds, each depending on their country, and send and receive money between users off-site with a guarantee and knowledge of each other as well.The site provides organizational possibility among users to confirm the sending and receipt of support amounts.\n\n

-The I received button on receipt of the amount and the Delete button when a user is removed and others are not included for non-payment. The explanation contains full clarification in the policies, terms and conditions.\n\n

    </string>
    The site has no relation to the process of sending and receiving support payments permanently, since the role of the site is the process of organization only.
    Organizational process is our responsibility:
    From arranging and sending organized codes for it.
    Giving the possibility to show pictures of the payment authorization to confirm the transmission.
    Giving the possibility of confirmation receipt of payment.
    Add to give the possibility of changing the user because of the seriousness of the second party.
    As well as organizing the exit of the recipient of financial support from partnership with his friends and the entry of the next (who has the role) in each account.
    In addition to ensuring the sending and receiving support amount for the form of friends at their own risk, and no income to the site in that, as the site does not deliver those funds.
